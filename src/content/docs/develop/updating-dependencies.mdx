## Update npm Packages

If you are using the `tauri` package:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest @tauri-apps/api@latest"
  yarn="yarn up @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api --latest"
/>

You can also detect what the latest version of Tauri is on the command line, using:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
  yarn="yarn outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
  pnpm="pnpm outdated @tauri-apps/cli"
/>

## Update Cargo Packages

You can check for outdated packages with [`cargo outdated`] or on the crates.io pages: [tauri] / [tauri-build].

Go to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and change `tauri` and `tauri-build` to

```toml
[build-dependencies]
tauri-build = "%version%"

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "%version%" }
```

{/* _TODO MIGRATED FROM V1 -> */}
where `%version%` is the corresponding version number from above. {/* TODO: (You can just use the `MAJOR.MINOR`) version, like `0.9`. */}

Then do the following:

```shell
cd src-tauri
cargo update
```

Alternatively, you can run the `cargo upgrade` command provided by [cargo-edit] which does all of this automatically.
