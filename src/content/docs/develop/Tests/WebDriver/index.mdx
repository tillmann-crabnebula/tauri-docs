:::caution[Currently in pre-alpha]

Webdriver support for Tauri is still in pre-alpha. Tooling that is dedicated to it, such as [tauri-driver], is still in
active development and may change as necessary over time. Additionally, only Windows and Linux are currently supported.

:::

[WebDriver] is a standardized interface to interact with web documents primarily intended for automated testing.
Tauri supports the [WebDriver] interface by leveraging the native platform's [WebDriver] server underneath a
cross-platform wrapper [`tauri-driver`].

## System Dependencies

Install the latest [`tauri-driver`] or update an existing installation by running:

```shell
cargo install tauri-driver
```

Because we currently utilize the platform's native [WebDriver] server, there are some requirements for running
[`tauri-driver`] on supported platforms. Platform support is currently limited to Linux and Windows.

### Linux

We use `WebKitWebDriver` on Linux platforms. Check if this binary exists already (command `which WebKitWebDriver`) as
some distributions bundle it with the regular WebKit package. Other platforms may have a separate package for them, such
as `webkit2gtk-driver` on Debian-based distributions.

### Windows

Make sure to grab the version of [Microsoft Edge Driver] that matches your Windows Edge version that the application is
being built and tested on. This should almost always be the latest stable version on up-to-date Windows installs. If the
two versions do not match, you may experience your WebDriver testing suite hanging while trying to connect.

The download contains a binary called `msedgedriver.exe`. [`tauri-driver`] looks for that binary in the `$PATH` so make
sure it's either available on the path or use the `--native-driver` option on [`tauri-driver`]. You may want to download this automatically as part of the CI setup process to ensure the Edge, and Edge Driver versions
stay in sync on Windows CI machines. A guide on how to do this may be added at a later date.

## Example Applications

Below are step-by-step guides to show how to create a minimal example application that
is tested with WebDriver.

If you prefer to see the result of the guide and look over a finished minimal codebase that utilizes it, you
can look at https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The above examples also comes with a CI script to test with GitHub actions, but you may still be interested in the below WebDriver CI guide as it explains the concept a bit more.
